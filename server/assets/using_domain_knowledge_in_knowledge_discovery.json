search area , called knowledge discovery or data min - ing , which addresses the problems in finding implicit , previously unknown , and potentially useful patterns from databases [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 211 .","Cur - rently , several successful tools that analyze databases for intersting and useful patterns have been reported in many areas of business , government , and science .","As examples , several banks , using patterns discov - ered in loan and credit histories , have derived bet - ter loan approval and bankruptcy prediction methods , and packaged-goods manufacturers have searched the supermarket scanner data to measure the effects of their promotions and to look for shopping patterns [ 16 ] .","We believe that data , intelligently analyzed and presented , are a valuable resource to be used for a competitive advantage in many areas .","During the last decade , we have seen an explosive growth of the size and number of databases with the advances in data acquisition and storage technologies .","For example , typical marketing databases contain sev - eral gigabytes of demographic and purchasing data .","When the system has to deal with large databases for knowledge discovery , there are major challenging is - sues , including computational efficiency and interest - ingness of patterns .","Computational efficiency means that the process of identifying useful patterns should be efficiently implemented on a computer .","Interesting - ness of patterns means the system should not generate too many patterns without focus .","In most cases , ex - haustive analysis of all the data is infeasible because of unacceptable performance .","It is often necessary to perform a relatively constrained search on a specific subset of data for desired knowledge to improve the 243 efficiency of the knowledge discovery process .","The key question is how we can find a relevant portion of the data without sacrificing the discovery of useful knowl - edge .","In this paper , we suggest a method to solve the problem by applying and extending techniques in semantic query optimization .","The semantic query optimization approaches take advantage of domain knowledge about the contents of a database for query optimization .","The basic idea is to use domain knowledge to reformulate a query into a less expensive yet equivalent query which produces the same answer as the original one .","Previous work on semantic query optimization has demonstrated that significant cost reduction can be achieved by using these techniques .","We believe the availability of rel - atively strong domain knowledge can also improve the efficiency of the knowledge discovery process by re - ducing the search space and help to focus on the in - teresting findings .","Many current knowledge discovery methods and tools do not incorporate domain knowl - edge .","There has not been any detailed discussion re - garding the use of domain knowledge in different as - pects of knowledge discovery .","This motivates the de - velopment of mechanisms using domain knowledge in knowledge discovery .","Our approach helps the system find a potentially relevant portion of the data by using domain knowledge which biases the search for interest - ing knowledge and narrows the focus of the knowledge discovery process .","In this paper , we introduce a method to utilize three types of domain knowledge in reducing the cost of find - ing a potentially relevant portion of the data while improving the quality of discovered knowledge .","The contribution of this paper is that we develop a general framework for using domain knowledge in the knowl - edge discovery process effectively by providing guide - lines .","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows .","Section 2 discusses motivating examples .","Section 3 surveys related works .","Section 4 describes our ap - proach to use domain knowledge in the knowledge dis - covery process .","Section 5 presents our conclusions and possible extensions of our work for future research 2 Motivating Examples The following examples illustrate the benifits of do - main knowledge in finding subsets of the population which are worthy of focused analysis .","Example 1 Suppose that we have a large ship leasing company database .","We are interested in find - ing useful patterns of all ships whose deadweight is greater than 700 tons and whose speed is greater than 60 mph .","Suppose we also have domain knowledge as follows : all ships whose deadweight is greater than 700 tons have their speed greater than 60 mph and ( the ships whose deadweight is greater than 700 tons are supertankers .","According to the domain knowl - edge , we need to consider only ships whose type is supertanker .","We can reformulate the query so that there is no need to check the speed and the dead - weight , which may save some execution time .","If there exists an index on the shipbpe , we can even save more execution time .","Example 2 Suppose that we have a database of car sale transactions .","We are interested in finding pat - terns about domestic sports cars whose price is lower than 15,000 .","Suppose we also have domain knowl - edge saying that there are no domestic sports cars whose price is less than 15,000 .","If we use the do - main knowledge , we do not need to access the database to find the patterns .","The domain knowledge is used to detect unsatisfiable conditions in the query , which prevents the exploration of search space .","Example 3 Let us consider a database of credit card transactions .","For example , a senior executive at , the company may wish to query , what are the spend - ing patterns of customers .","If we have domain knowl - edge to categorize customers into various meaningful groups , eg senior , mid-old , middle , and young cus - tomers based on age , or high , middle , and low income customers based on income , then we can provide the information to the executive to help him / her make useful and meaningful queries by refining the original query or posing more restrictions on the query while constructing the search space .","Now , the executive can ask what are the spending patterns of senior cus - tomers with a high income , which can provide more meaningful information to the executive .","Example 4 Let us consider an employee database .","We are interested in finding information about employ - ees whose salary is greater than 50,000 .","Assume that we have domain knowledge describing meaningful cor - relations among attributes .","For example , salary , posi - tion , and education are correlated but salary , address , and social security number are not .","If we use such do - main knowledge , we don t have to consider unrelated attributes such as address and social security number because there is litt , le chance to find useful patterns from those unrelated attributes .","As you see from the above examples , it is useful to take advantage of domain knowledge for knowledge discovery .","Domain knowledge can be used t , o reduce 244 the size of the database that is being searched for dis - covery by eliminating data records or irrelevant at - tributes that are not needed for discovery or refining the original query by posing more restrictions .","We can transform a knowledge discovery query with con - ditions into another query which is more efficiently processed with domain knowledge .","In addition , we can infer that a knowledge discovery query is unsatis - fiable if it contradicts domain knowledge .","In this case , there is no need to access the database to find infor - mation .","If we use domain knowledge in the knowledge discovery process while evaluating a knowledge dis - covery query , we can make the discovery process more intelligent and avoid wasting time trying to deal with meaningless data 3 Related Work In this section , we discuss some of the works related to our approach in t he areas of data mining and se - mantic query optimization .","The purpose of knowledge discovery is to facilitate the understanding of large amounts of data by discovering interesting patterns .","Many different methods for knowledge discovery have been proposed in the context of relational database systems [ l , 2 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 211 .","A recent book by Piatetsky-Shapiro and Frawley [ lG ] contains a collection of articles about various approaches to pat - tern discovery .","Frawley et a1 [ 16 ] define patterns as follows : Given a set of facts ( data ) F , a language L , and some measure of certainty C , a pattern S is a statement S in L that describes relationships among a subset F , of F with certainty C , such that S is simpler than the enumeration of all facts in F , .","Some databases are so large that even the fastest algorithms for knowledge discovery can be too expen - sive to apply to all data .","There are several approaches that can be utilized in order to minimize the search efforts .","One simplest method is to randomly sample a database .","However , this method may hinder the dis - covery of useful knowledge .","Even though sampling is appropriate , it is difficult to decide how much to sam - ple .","Another possibility is to use other database utili - ties such as OLAP ( On-Line Analytical Processing ) to specify a subset of data .","However , it is not always possible to use those utilities in order to restrict the set of data .","Klemettinen et al [ 13 ] propose to reduce the num - ber of generated rules by having a user specify tem - plates , which define the structure of interesting as - sociation rules ( ie , what attributes occur in the an - tecedent and what attributes are in the consequent ) and restrict the items that can be used in the rule .","This is accomplished by organizing the items into a classification hierarchy , and using this information to guide the rule selection process .","Shen et al . [ 19 ] introduce the notion of metaqueries for guiding the data mining process .","Similar to templates , metaque - ries work by specifying an abstract form that the rule must satisfy .","Metaqueries in their most general form are most useful for mining data from different rela - tions in a database .","These approaches require greater interaction from users to identify an interesting por - tion of data .","It is often difficult for users to predict what kinds of patterns should be mined beforehand .","We believe another effective approach is to apply and extend techniques in semantic query optimization to the knowledge discovery process .","Semantic query optimization can be regarded as the process of trans - forming a query into an equivalent form , which can be evaluated efficiently .","There have been some interesting studies on semantic query optimization in relational and deductive databases .","King [ ll ] describes an algo - rithm which uses a set of transformation heuristics .","These heuristics help to limit the number of transfor - mations by specifying how each heuristic can be used to transform a given query .","Xu [ 25 ] presents heuris - tics similar to King s , adding a control strategy for selecting appropriate transformations .","Hammer and Zdonik [ S ] describe how a system can use a knowledge base to perform semantic query optimization .","Jarke et al . [ lO ] describe a graph-theoretic approach to semantic query simplication implemented in Prolog .","Similarly , Shenoy and Ozsoyoglu [ 20 ] suggest a graph-theoretic approach to achieve semantic query optimization by identifying redundant conditions and eliminating them from the query graph .","Chakravarthy et a1 [ 4 ] describe a method to modify query expressions by comparing them with semantic knowledge expressions and form - ing new expressions .","The modified query should then be easier to answer than the original query .","In this paper , we apply and extend the approaches developed for semantic query optimization to the knowledge discovery process .","In our approach , we in - troduce a specific method to represent domain knowl - edge and suggest strategies to control the size and quality of data explored in the knowledge discovery process by using domain knowledge .","These issues are not addressed in [ 13 ] and [ 19 ] .","We believe our ap - proach increases the chances of finding patterns that are of interest to the users and can make the knowl - edge discovery process more efficient by constraining the search space 245 4 Our Discovery System In this section , we describe our approach to use three types of domain knowledge in the knowledge dis - covery process .","In many discovery applications , a key phase is to find a subset of the population which is worthy of focused analysis .","Our approach allows do - main knowledge to be incorporated into the key phase .","Our approach consists of two phases : preprocessing and execution .","The preprocessing phase organizes do - main knowledge for fast access and is done once before knowledge discovery queries are issued .","The execution phase accesses domain knowledge and applies it to im - prove the knowledge discovery query .","We now consider each phase in detail 4.1 Preprocessing In this phase , we collect all domain knowledge and represent it in different forms according to the types .","Domain knowledge , not belonging to data , may orig - inate from many sources , including specifications and domain experts .","It is often possible for domain experts to provide significant amounts of domain knowledge .","Newly discovered patterns can be added to the set of domain knowledge and used in the future as domain knowledge .","Our domain knowledge can be classified into three types : interfield , category , and correlation .","Interfield domain knowledge which describes rela - tionships among attributes of a relation can be repre - sented in the following rule form : If ( AlopB ) and / or ... and / or ( A , - lopB , -1 ) then ( A , opB , ) and / or ... and / or ( A , opB , ) where Ai , 15 i m , is the name of an attribute , op is normally one of the operators , , 2 , , 2 , f , and Bj , 11 j m , is a constant value from the domain of the attribute Aj or the name of an attribute .","The do - main knowledge in example 1 shows the relationships among attributes of the relation ship and is therefore interfield domain knowledge .","It can be represented as follows : If deadweight 700 then speed 60 If deadweight 700 then shiptype supertanker The domain knowledge in example 2 is also interfield domain knowledge and can be represented as follows : If type domestic sports car then price 15000 As usual , the conditions between if and then form the body of the piece of knowledge , and the con - ditions after then form the head .","Category domain knowledge represents useful cate - gories for the domain of an attribute and can be rep - resented in the following rule form : If ( AlopBl ) and / or ... and / or ( A , - lopB , -1 ) 246 then A , , abstract concept where Ai , 15 i In , is the name of an attribute , op is normally one of the operators , , , , 2 , , and Bj , 15 j n-l , is a specific value from the do - main of the attribute Aj or an abstract concept which is previously defined in other category domain knowl - edge .","An abstract concept is a high-level concept to summarize the values which satisfy conditions .","Dif - ferent values in the domain may be generalized to the same abstract concept .","Category domain knowledge might be views or summaries of data .","For example , customers in the example 3 can be divided into four meaningful categories based on age : senior , mid-old , middle , and young .","The category domain knowledge can be represented as follows : If ( age265 ) then age senior If ( age 45 ) and ( age 65 ) then age mid-old If ( age235 ) and ( age 45 ) then age middle If ( age 35 ) then age Young Similarly , we can define other abstract concepts .","For example , we can also divide customers into three meaningful categories based on income : high , mid - dle , and low .","Category domain knowledge can also be formed by combining two or more abstract concepts .","That is , abstract concepts across multiple attributes can form category domain knowledge .","Such domain knowledge represents global relationships among ab - stract concepts from different attributes .","For example , we can define loyal customers with the abstract con - cepts defined in age and income attributes as follows : If age middle and income high then customer-type loyal .","Similarly , we can define the abstract concept Honor Students by combining the abstract concept Under - graduate in the attribute class and the abstract con - cept Excellent in the attribute GPA in a student rela - tion .","Any existing attribute can be used to define mean - ingful categories if the attribute has a set of values and finite number of meaningful high-level concepts for those values is existed .","That is , if the attribute domain is divided into several meaningful groups and each group can be represented by a meaningful con - cept , then we can define categories for the attribute .","The category domain knowledge provides varying lev - els of abstraction that can be accessed based on the specific goals of the data analysis .","Correlation domain knowledge suggests correlations among attributes and can be represented in a set form .","For example , domain knowledge saying that educa - tion , position , and income are correlated can be rep - resented as education , position , income .","For exam - ple , if our task is to find patterns related to income , we may focus on position and education , not name or address , because it is unlikely that income and name are correlated .","If we have domain knowledge saying that profits , sales , and expenses are related , then we might consider the attributes , sales and expenses to find patterns related to profits .","If correlation domain knowledge can rank the relevance of all the related at - tributes , we select only the highly ranked attributes or leave the selection to the user to decide where to draw the line .","If we use this type of domain knowledge , we can eliminate some attributes that are redundant , irrelevant , or unimportant to a given discovery task .","To select relevant domain knowledge without an ex - haustive search of domain knowledge , we define a clus - ter of an attribute P to be a set of domain knowledge related to the attribute P. Each cluster has three parts , one for each domain knowledge type .","So , we can eas - ily find each domain knowledge type in the cluster .","Grouping domain knowledge into clusters avoids un - necessary search on a large body of irrelevant domain knowledge .","We store those clusters in a table and cre - ate an index on the attributes in the table to speed up the retrieval of domain knowledge .","For example , if we have an attribute income in an employee relation , we might have the following cluster for the attribute in the domain knowledge table . attribute name type domain knowledge income interfield if income 50000 then position manager category if income 60000 - - then income high else if income 35000 then income middle else income low correlation education , position Our approach can save considerable time because searching through domain knowledge to find ones that are applicable to a given query can be done efficiently 4.2 Execution In the execution phase , we receive a knowledge dis - covery query , identify domain knowledge that is rele - vant to the query , and transform the query with the domain knowledge into another form which is more ef - ficiently processed .","During this stage , we can reduce the search space or discard the query itself totally by using only relevant domain knowledge among all do - main knowledge .","How can relevant domain knowledge be detected","In our approach , the relevance is decided by a query context .","Interfield domain knowledge is rel - evant to a query if a subset of the conditions in the query implies the body of domain knowledge .","Cate - gory domain knowledge is relevant to a query if the query includes conditions to be categorized .","Correla - tion domain knowledge is relevant to a query if the query includes attributes which have a list of relevant fields .","Upon receiving a query , we bring potentially relevant domain knowledge from the domain knowl - edge table by using the index created in the prepro - cessing phase and then check if any domain knowledge is relevant to the query .","We can select relevant domain knowledge without an exhaustive search of all domain knowledge .","Each selected relevant domain knowledge is processed according to its type as follows : Case 1 : interfield domain knowledge To process a query with this type of domain knowl - edge , we use the head of the relevant domain knowl - edge to transform the query into an equivalent one , which can be evaluated efficiently .","The head of the domain knowledge can be used in one of the following two ways 1 ) The head of th e relevant domain knowledge implies a subset of the conditions in the query : we can remove the subset from the query , which can eliminate the un - necessary and redundant restrictions in the knowledge discovery query . 2 ) The head of the relevant domain knowledge gives useful additional restrictions to attributes involved in a query : we add the restrictions to the query , which can reduce the processing cost and the number of inner scans of the relation .","In example 1 , a user formulates the query , asking find interesting knowledge of all ships whose dead - weight is greater than 700 and whose speed is greater than 60 mph .","To process this request , we first look at the domain knowledge table for those two attributes , deadweight and speed .","Assume that we have the same domain knowledge as in example 1 .","The do - main knowledge is relevant to the query because the body of the domain knowledge is true .","After relevant domain knowledge is found , reformulation process is performed .","If we use the head of the first domain knowledge , we can eliminate the second condition in the query which is redundant .","If we use the head of the second domain knowledge , the first condition is changed to shiptype supertanker .","The original query is reformulated as follows : Find interesting knowledge of all ships whose ship - type is supertanker In the example 2 , a user formulates the query , ask - 247 ing find interesting knowledge of all sports cars whose price is less than 15000 .","Assume that we have the same domain knowledge as in example 2 .","The domain knowledge is relevant to the query because the body of the domain knowledge is true .","If we use the head of the domain knowledge , we don t have to access the database because the condition in the query contra - dicts the domain knowledge .","Case 2 : category domain knowledge To process a query with this type of domain knowl - edge , we identify conditions on which additional con - straints might be meaningful .","Then , we find relevant categories for the conditions in the query and show them to a user .","The user can select useful and mean - ingful categories and refine the original query by pos - ing more restrictions .","That is , we can ask a user ad - ditional constraints or restrictions to be included as part of conditions in a knowledge discovery query by showing categories related to a given task .","This kind of domain knowledge enables the user to specify the level of analysis at which the system should focus and provides an interface for users to specify the set of data of interest easily according to their needs .","In the example 3 , we have four categories based on age and three categories based on income .","We show those categories to the user , and the user can select some interesting categories .","The original query can be re - formulated as what are the spending patterns of se - nior customers with a high income or what are the spending patterns of loyal customers .","In this case , the user narrows the search to senior customers with a high income or loyal customers .","To process the reformuIated query , abstract concepts contained in the reformuIated query are identified and then appropri - ate mappings are performed to transform the abstract concepts into the set , of the conditions based on the primitive data .","Case 3 : correlation domain knowledge To process a query with this type of domain knowl - edge , we look at the domain knowledge table and find a list of attributes related to the attributes in the query .","In example 4 , we need to find patterns related to in - come .","If we use the domain knowledge in example 4 , education and position are relevant fields on which to focus attention .","This type of domain knowledge sug - gests which fields are appropriate for a given task .","We can reduce the size of data set by limiting the number of attributes .","Using domain knowledge to bias the search for meaningful patterns leaves some portion of search space unexplored .","Our approach allows backtracking to be initiated for further exploration on the unex - plored portion of search space if more patterns are needed .","For example , if we use more than one cat - egory domain knowledge in query reformulation , we can remove some of them and reprocess the query .","For example , if the reformulated query has two ab - stract concepts , say , senior and high income , then we can drop one of the abstract concepts .","So , we find the spending patterns of senior customers or high income customers .","If correlation domain knowledge is used in the reformulated query , we might add attributes which are excluded in the query reformulation process .","For example , we might add another attribute such as num - ber of dependents to the query in example 4 5 Conclusion The amount of information stored in databases is exploding .","Large amounts of data need to be sum - marized or reduced to descriptions of a form .","Thus , knowledge discovery in databases has been attract - ing significant attention in the past , few years .","The challenge of knowledge discovery is to process large quantities of raw data efficiently , while producing the most significant and meaningful patterns for achieving a user s goal .","Exhaustive analysis is almost impossible on the megabytes , gigabytes , or even tera-bytes of data in many real-world databases .","In these situations , the system shouId focus its analysis on samples of data by selecting specific fields and / or subsets of records .","In this paper , we have presented a method for us - ing domain knowledge which assists the discovery pro - cess by focusing search and helps make the discovered knowledge more meaningful to a user .","In particular , we look at the use of domain knowledge to constrain or prune the search space and optimize knowledge dis - covery queries used to find interesting patterns .","In addition , we suggest a method to select relevant do - main knowledge without an exhaustive search of do - main knowledge .","Our approach provides a simple and reasonable way of using domain knowledge in very large databases in conjuction with the current discovery methods .","Our approach can be incorporated as a component in cur - rent discovery systems .","Our approach increases the chance of finding pat terns that are of interest to the user and can make the knowledge discovery process more efficient by constraining the search space .","In the near future , we might need to develop heuris - tics which help select the most promising set of domain knowledge .","It is an interesting topic to measure the quality of each domain knowledge by its discrimina - tion power , its generality , and its interestingness for 248 future research .","Currently , we are building a proto - type system to perform experimentation on the pro - posed methods .","References PI PI PI PI [ 51 PI PI PI PI El01 [ 111 R.
