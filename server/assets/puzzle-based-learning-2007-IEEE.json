man seminar introduced at the University of California , Santa Barbara , to motivate and retain computer engineering students1 The author argues that attracting students to com - puter science and engineering programs represents only one aspect of a broader problem , the shortage of a skilled information technology workforce , and that recruitment efforts must be augmented with additional strategies for retaining and motivating students strategies that are missing in curricula recommendations of the IEEE Com - puter Society and the ACM .","The problem may be even broader .","Today s market - place needs more skilled graduates capable of solving real problems of innovation in a changing environment .","Miss - ing in the majority of engineering and computer science curricula is a focus on developing problem-solving skills .","Further , many courses that introduce elements of problem - solving skills do so at the programs third or fourth level , after students have already faced the majority of their in - academy intellectual challenges .","While some courses with a design content emphasis might meet this requirement , most engineering students never learn how to think about solving problems in gen - eral .","Throughout their education , they are constrained to concentrate on textbook questions at the end of each chapter , solved using material discussed in the chapter .","This constrained form of problem solving is not suffi - cient preparation for addressing real-world problems .","On entering the real world , students find that problems do not come with instructions or a guidebook .","One of our favorite examples for illustrating this point is a puzzle on breaking a chocolate bar : A rectangular chocolate bar consists of m Ãƒ n small rect - angles , and you wish to break it into its constituent parts .","At each step , you can only pick up one piece and break it along any of its vertical or horizontal lines .","How should you break the chocolate bar using the minimum number of steps","If you do not know the answer , which textbook would you search to discover the solution","The same applies to solving many real-world problems : Which textbook should you search to find a solution , if that is the solution strategy you ve learned","Students often have difficulty applying independent thinking or problem-solving skills regardless of the nature of a problem .","At the same time , educators are interested in teaching thinking skills rather than teaching infor - mation and content The latter approach has dominated in the past .","As Alex Fisher2 wrote though many teachers would claim to teach their students how to think , most Puzzle-Based Learning for Engineering and Computer Science Nickolas Falkner , University of Adelaide Raja Sooriamurthi , Carnegie Mellon University Zbigniew Michalewicz , University of Adelaide r4fal.indd 20 3/26/10 12:58 PM 21AprIL 2010 Simplicity Educational puzzles should be easy to state and remem - ber","This is important because easy-to-remember puzzles increase the chance students will remember the solution method , including the universal mathematical problem - solving principles .","Eureka factor Educational puzzles should initially frustrate the prob - lem solver , but hold out the promise of resolution .","A puzzle should be interesting because its result is not immediately intuitive .","Problem solvers often use intuition to start their quest for the solution , and this approach can lead them astray .","Eventually they reach a Eureka moment Martin Gardner s Aha when students recognize the correct path to solving the puzzle .","A sense of relief accompanies this moment , and the frustration felt during the process dissi - pates , giving the problem solvers a sense of reward at their cleverness for solving the puzzle .","The Eureka factor also implies that educational puzzles should have elementary solutions that are not obvious .","Entertainment factor Educational puzzles should be entertaining and engag - ing .","Entertainment is often a side effect of simplicity , frustration , the Eureka factor , and an interesting setting such as playing in a casino environment , fighting against dragons , or dropping eggs from a tower .","ThE LurE of EducaTion Educational puzzles can play a major role in attracting students to computer science and engineering programs , and can be used in talks to high school students and during open-day events .","Puzzles can also be a factor that helps retain and motivate students .","Above all , they are responsible for developing critical thinking and problem - solving skills as well as raising the profile and importance of mathematics .","Further , there is a strong connection between the ability to solve puzzles and the ability to solve industry and business problems .","Many real-world problems can be perceived as large-scale puzzles .","William Poundstone , when investigating the purpose of famous Microsoft / Silicon Valley interview puzzles,7 wrote , At Microsoft , and now at many other companies , it is believed that there are parallels between the reasoning used to solve puzzles and the thought processes involved in solving the real would say that they do this indirectly or implicitly in the course of teaching the content which belongs to their spe - cial subject .","Increasingly , educators have come to doubt the effectiveness of teaching thinking skills in this way , because most students simply do not pick up the thinking skills in question Further , many analysts lament students decreas - ing mathematical skills .","A recent Mathematics Working Party Final Report , issued by the University of Adelaide,3 includes statements such as , There is an urgent need to raise the profile and importance of mathematics among young people and The declining participation in math - ematics and related subjects is not limited to Australia Our universities , the University of Adelaide and Carne - gie Mellon University , have introduced a new puzzle-based learning course to address all the issues raised here .","PuzzLE-baSEd LEarning aPProach The puzzle-based learning approach aims to encourage engineering and computer science students to think about how they frame and solve problems not encountered at the end of some textbook chapter .","Our goal is to motivate students while increasing their mathematical awareness and problem-solving skills by discussing a variety of puz - zles and their solution strategies .","The course is based on the best traditions introduced by Gyorgy Polya and Martin Gardner over the past 60 years4,5 Many teachers have used puzzles for teaching purposes , and the puzzle-based learning approach has a tradition that exceeds 60 years6 Historians found the first mathematical puzzles in Sumerian texts from circa 2500 BC .","However , some of the best evidence for the puzzle-based learning approach can be found in the works of Alcuin , an English scholar born around 732 AD , whose main work , Prob - lems to Sharpen the Young , included more than 50 puzzles .","Some 1,200 years later , one of Alcuin s puzzles the river crossing problem is still used in artificial intelligence textbooks to educate computer science students .","In our course , we concentrate on educational puzzles that support problem-solving skills and creative thinking .","These educational puzzles satisfy most of the following criteria . independence The puzzles are not specifically tied to a single prob - lem-solving domain . generality Educational puzzles should explain some universal math - ematical problem-solving principles .","This is key .","Most people agree that problem solving can only be learned by actually solving problems .","This activity , however , must be supported by instructor-provided strategies .","These general strategies allow for solving yet unknown problems in the future .","There is a strong connection between the ability to solve puzzles and the ability to solve industry and business problems . r4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplacer4fal.indd 21 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM computer 22 COMPUTING PR ACTICES problems of innovation and a changing marketplace [ ]","When technology is changing beneath your feet daily , there is not much point in hiring for a specific , soon-to-be-obsolete set of skills .","You have to try to hire for general problem-solving capacity , how -

based learning requires significant domain knowledge .","This is the form of learning typically emphasized in a domain-specific undergraduate course such as electro - magnetism , data structures , or circuit theory .","Project-based learning , on the other hand , deals with complex situa - tions in which usually no clearly unique or correct way of proceeding exists .","For example , How can we increase the adherence of cystic fibrosis patients to following their treatment protocol","Determining the best solution in such a situation can be difficult .","The pedagogical objectives of project-based learning include dealing with ambiguity and complexity , integrating a variety of approaches , user testing of the pro - posed solutions value , and working with a team composed of diverse backgrounds and skills .","In both problem-based and project-based learning , the problem drives the learning : Students must assess what they already know , the knowledge they need to address the problem , and how to bridge the knowledge and skill gap .","Puzzle-based learning focuses on domain - independent critical thinking and abstract reasoning .","This leads us to ask , What is the dif - ference between a puzzle and a problem","One way to characterize the difference measures the extent to which domain-specific knowledge is needed to solve it .","The general flavor of puzzles asserts that their solution should require only domain-neutral general rea - soning skills biologists , musicians , and artists should all be able to solve the same puzzle .","The different styles of reasoning required for problem-based and puzzle-based learning could be compared to the difference between a field investigator and an armchair detective : one empha - sizes pure reasoning more . dropping eggs The well-known egg-drop experiment provides an example that compares and contrasts problem-based and puzzle-based learning .","The traditional problem-based learning version of this experiment involves finding a way to drop an egg from a maximal height without breaking it .","A puzzle-based learning version of this experiment also involves dropping an egg from a building , but the question under investigation , although related , is quite different .","In the problem-based learning approach , students con - duct a series of physical experiments to determine how to maximize the height from which an egg can be dropped without breaking .","There are two broad approaches : Dampen the impact s effect ( leading to padding-based solutions ) or lessening the impact ( leading to delivery mechanisms such as a parachute ) .","The team-based learn - ing outcomes of such an experiment determine different ways to dampen or lessen an impact .","A puzzle-based learning approach to a similar prob - lem does not involve a physical experiment , but rather a thought experiment .","One approach would be to ask a question along the lines of the following : Using multiple eggs , what would be an effective strategy for determining the highest floor from which I could drop an egg without breaking it","This question has interesting variations .","This thought experiment has three entities : the number of eggs , number of drops , and number of floors .","One puzzle-based learning question could be , Given a fixed number of eggs and a number of allowed drops , what is the maximum height of a building whose breaking floor we can determine","This could be denoted as F e , d .","Real world Abstract / model world Working in teams identifying the question Acquisition of domain knowledge Critical thinking logical reasoning Dealing with uncertainty and changing conditions Reasoning with domain-speciÃ¯ c methods Abstract reasoning domain independent figure 1 .","Problem solving in the real world requires a continuum of learning and skills in which each layer of skills builds upon the layers below it . r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f r4fal.indd 22 3 / 26 / 10 12 : 58 PM 23AprIL 2010 An alternate question could be , Given a fixed number of floors say , 100 and a number of eggs say , three what is the maximum number of drops needed to determine the breaking floor ( D e , f","Yet another version might be to ask how many eggs would be needed to determine the breaking floor given a fixed number of floors and allowed number of drops ( E f , d ) .","Note that all three puzzle-based learning versions of the problem require only basic math skills and analytical reasoning .","One goal of puzzle-based learning is to foster the skill of analyzing and understanding problems clearly .","Part of this requires the clarification of any assumptions needed to solve the problem .","For example , for the egg-drop thought experiment , some reasonable assumptions include all eggs behave the same way and an egg that survives a drop is not damaged and may be dropped again To constrain the problem , we would consider assumptions such as an egg surviving a drop from floor x would have survived a drop from any floor less than x . Suppose , given a fixed number of eggs , e , and a specified number of drops , d , we want to determine the maximal height of a building whose breaking floor we can deter - mine ( F e , d ) .","Applying the heuristic of try to solve a similar but simpler problem , let us consider the situation where we have only one egg ( e 1 ) .","In this case , we are required to search sequentially .","If we are allowed 10 drops ( d 10 ) , then we can deter - mine the breaking floor of a ten-floor building by starting at floor one and working our way up .","Now suppose we had two eggs ( e 2 ) .","What strategy could we follow","Students who have had some prior programming experience often give binary search as a possible strategy , although this is not the best solution .","Students are led through the reasoning process in a lecture environment and encouraged to contribute and refine their suggestions , with controlled prompting .","By considering examples and reasoning about what happens if the first egg does or doesn t break , students are guided through the general version of this puzzle , culminating in the derivation of the general solution .","Puzzle-based learning shares many pedagogical goals with the emerging paradigm of computational thinking10 Puzzle-based learning resonates with the computational thinking emphasis on abstraction and analytical thinking .","With reference to Figure 1 , computational thinking strad -

work , identifies key points for that week s lectures , then builds on the topic area .","The lecture concludes with the next assignment .","Lectures are recorded and the lecture slides , recordings , and all assignment work made avail - able on the course s electronic forum .","These forums also provide message boards for student interaction .","PBL Main has a second lecture that develops the themes of the week s topic .","Lecture materials are devel -

tations .","This addresses the differences in mathematical preparation identified in the intake .","While a good grasp of mathematics can be useful for PBL , it is not essential .","Problem specification has been a key concern , as the larger classes contain students accustomed to a completely specified problem , and thus feel uncomfortable when confronted with problems not completely specified or , in the student s opinion , not suf -

ments , three exams , and a few in-class quizzes .","It has been gratifying to see that the response to the class has been favorable , with some students commenting it was the best class they had that semester .","Some have also com - mented on the revisiting of PBL themes in their subsequent hand-in time , to let students immediately gain feedback on the quality of their solution .","PBL-E s student numbers posed a significant resource issue : Without detailed feedback , it takes approximately two to three minutes to mark each assignment .","Thus , the marking load starts at approximately eight hours for each assignment , with a team of markers employed and trained to provide consistency of response .","PBL Main has a much smaller enrollment but employs detailed , personalized feedback that also takes approxi - mately eight hours to complete a week s assignments .","The requirement for a consistent and reproducible marking scheme that can be assigned to multiple markers con - strains the range of problems that can be offered .","Problems with too many possible solutions become effectively impossible to mark across 450 students .","In response to this , we have considered many alterna - tives and are currently developing problems that might have multiple possible solutions , all of which may appear to be correct when , in fact , only one is .","Again , this is an issue of problem and solution specification .","Controlled use of multiple-choice questions , with between eight and ten options , lets markers quickly identify the flaw in reasoning and correctly mark the student s work .","We also investigate the possibility of reducing the dependency on a mark - based assessment for this course .","Early student response shows that they enjoy the course material and it does develop their thinking skills .","However , several students , especially in PBL-E , encounter issues with the assessment model and its perceived lack of feed - back .","Others worry that the assessment mechanism can develop a negative and unproductive approach to the course .","We are actively seeking to address these concerns by allocating more resources to marking and feedback , and through the use of automated marking mechanisms that allow more rapid response .","Future implementations of PBL-E may include tutorials or alternative assessment mechanisms . carnEgiE mELLon univErSiTy Carnegie Mellon University offered puzzle-based learn -
